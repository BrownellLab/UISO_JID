abstract = {Viral infection and type I interferon have been implicated in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia (BA), but the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize viruses, as well as of type 1 interferon specific signaling molecules are still unknown in BA. Fresh liver tissues were obtained from patients in early and late stage of BA and from patients with choledochal cyst (CC), as well as from normal controls receiving liver resection for benign lesion other than cholestasis or fibrosis. Archived liver tissues from patients with neonatal hepatitis (NH) were obtained for immunohistochemical studies. TLR2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 that recognized Gram-positive bacteria, double-stranded RNA virus, lipopolysaccharide, single-stranded RNA virus and DNA virus, respectively, were studied. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was used to quantitate TLR, type I interferon specific molecule MxA, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry for TLR 7 and MxA protein staining. These results show that there were significantly higher TLR7 and lower TLR3 and TLR9 mRNA expression in early stage of BA than in CC. MxA mRNA expression was also significantly higher in early stage of BA and in CC than in late stage of BA. Immunoreactive TLR7 and MxA staining was higher in early stage of BA than in late stage of BA, NH and CC, which was associated with significantly higher IL-8 mRNA expression in BA than in CC. The results implicate involvement of TLRs, particularly TLR7, and type 1 specific interferon signaling in the pathogenesis of BA, especially in early stage, which is associated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-8.},

@article{Bhatia2010Merkel,
abstract = {Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was recently discovered in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous malignancy of dermal neuroendocrine cells. To investigate this heterogeneity, we developed a tissue microarray (TMA) to characterize immunohistochemical staining of candidate tumor cell proteins and a quantitative PCR assay to detect MCPyV and measure viral loads. MCPyV was detected in 19 of 23 (74\%) primary MCC tumors, but 8 of these had less than 1 viral copy per 300 cells. Viral abundance of 0.06-1.2 viral copies/cell was directly related to presence of retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) by immunohistochemical staining (p < or = 0.003). Higher viral abundance tumors tended to be associated with less p53 expression, younger age at diagnosis and longer survival (p < or = 0.08). These data suggest that MCC may arise through different oncogenic pathways, including ones independent of pRb and MCPyV.},

@article{Sihto2011Merkel,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is rare skin cancer that is often associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection. Polyomaviruses repress tumor suppressor proteins, thus influencing cell-cycle progression, but the effect of MCPyV on the key cell-cycle regulating proteins is poorly understood.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated expression of the MCPyV large T-antigen (LTA), Ki-67, and the key putative tumor suppressor proteins, the retinoblastoma protein (RB and phospho-RB) and p53, and their regulatory proteins (cyclin D1, cyclin E, p16, p21, p27, and MDM2) by using immunohistochemistry from tumors of 91 MCC patients identified from a population-based nationwide cohort. Tumor MCPyV DNA was measured by using quantitative PCR, and TP53 mutations were identified with sequencing.

RESULTS: MCPyV LTA expression was strongly associated with presence of MCPyV DNA in tumor, and it was almost invariably associated with tumor RB expression (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Both MCC LTA and RB expression were strongly associated with favorable MCC-specific and overall survival in univariable analyses (P ≤ 0.01 for all four analyses). Presence of MCPyV LTA was also associated with the female gender, the intermediate type of tumor histology, location of the tumor in a limb, cell proliferation rate, and absence of p53 expression. TP53 mutations were detected only in MCPyV DNA-negative tumors.

CONCLUSIONS: MCPyV DNA-positive MCC has several clinical and molecular features that differ from MCPyV DNA-negative cancers. MCPyV-associated MCCs express RB, but may not harbor TP53 mutations. These findings provide further support that MCPyV causes the majority of MCCs.},

@article{Waltari2011Association,
abstract = {Most Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs) contain Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) DNA, and the virus likely has a pivotal role in tumor pathogenesis. p53 and the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase have also been implicated in MCC pathogenesis, but little is known about their association with MCPyV infection. We identified 207 patients diagnosed with MCC in Finland in 1979-2004 and reviewed the histological diagnoses. Adequate clinical information, tumor tissue and DNA were available from 87 confirmed MCC cases. Presence of MCPyV DNA was assessed using quantitative PCR; p53, KIT, phospho-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF) and PDGFR$\alpha$ expression using immunohistochemistry and presence of mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 and PDGFRA exons 10, 12, 14 and 18 using DNA sequencing. Most (77.0\%) of the 87 tumors contained MCPyV DNA and 37 (42.5\%) expressed KIT, whereas PDGFR$\alpha$, p53, SCF and pKIT expression was less common (31.9, 22.8, 8.6 and 4.8\%, respectively). No KIT or PFGFRA mutations were detected, but 10 (12.5\%) of the 80 tumors studied harbored common PDGFRA exon 10 S478P substitution. Tumor p53 and KIT expression were associated with absence of MCPyV DNA (p = 0.01 and 0.009, respectively). Tumor p53 expression was associated with unfavorable MCC-specific survival (p = 0.021) and overall survival (p = 0.046), but tumor KIT expression only when stratified by presence of MCPyV DNA. The results suggest that p53 and KIT expression are associated with absence of MCPyV DNA in MCC, and that the molecular pathogenesis of MCC is multifactorial.},

@article{Smyth2004Linear,
    abstract = {
                The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.

    abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate ({FWER}). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Li2008Genomic,
    abstract = {Genetic aberrations, such as gene amplification, deletions, and loss of heterozygosity, are hallmarks of cancer and are thought to be major contributors to the neoplastic process. Established cancer cell lines have been the primary in vitro and in vivo models for cancer for more than 2 decades; however, few such cell lines have been extensively characterized at the genomic level. Here, we present a high-resolution genome-wide chromosomal alteration and gene expression analyses of five of the most commonly used glioma cell lines and compare the findings with those observed in 83 primary human gliomas. Although genomic alterations known to occur in primary tumors were identified in the cell lines, we also observed several novel recurrent aberrations in the glioma cell lines that are not frequently represented in primary tumors. Additionally, a global gene expression cluster distinct from primary tumors was identified in the glioma cell lines. Our results indicate that established cell lines are generally a poor representation of primary tumor biology, presenting a host of genomic and gene expression changes not observed in primary tissues, although some discrete features of glioma biology were conserved in the established cell lines. Refined maps of genetic alterations and transcriptional divergence from the original tumor type, such as the one presented here, may help serve as a guideline for a more biologically rational and clinically relevant selection of the most appropriate glioma model for a given experiment.

@article{Khan2001Classification,
    abstract = {
                The purpose of this study was to develop a method of classifying cancers to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression signatures using artificial neural networks ({ANNs}). We trained the {ANNs} using the small, round blue-cell tumors ({SRBCTs}) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The {ANNs} correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in {SRBCTs}, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained {ANN} models to recognize {SRBCTs}, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy.

                Since our initial reports on chromosomal studies in eight Ewing's sarcomas ({ES}), we have carried out similar investigations on 23 additional {ES} specimens following short-term culture of tumor cells (16 cases), and established in vitro cell lines (three cases) and on xenografted tumors in nude mice (four cases). We demonstrated the presence of the reciprocal t(11;22)(q24;q12) in every case except one that exhibited a complex t(11;22;14)(q24;q12;q11). On the basis of results from these additional 23 cases, we confirm the consistency of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) in {ES}. Moreover, we reviewed 54 {ES} cases reported by other investigators; when added to our 31 cases, this brings the total number to 85 unrelated cases of {ES} available for an evaluation of the frequency of involvement of bands 11q24 and 22q12 in translocations in {ES}. The standard t(11;22)(q24;q12) proved to be a remarkably consistent event, present in 83\% of the cases. Five percent of the cases exhibited complex translocations involving a third chromosome in addition to chromosomes \#11 and \#22. In 4\% of the cases variant translocations involved 22q12 but with a chromosome(s) other than \#11. The breakpoint on chromosome 22q12 appears to be the most consistently observed event in 92\% of the cases, whereas, the breakpoint at chromosome 11q24 was observed in 88\% of the cases.

@article{Fischer2010Detection,
    abstract = {
                The recently discovered human polyomavirus ({MCPyV}) is frequently found in Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) tissue and is believed to be causally linked to {MCC} pathogenesis. While cell lines established from {MCC} represent a valuable tool to study the contribution of {MCPyV} to {MCC} pathogenesis, hitherto only 1 {MCPyV}-positive line has been described. We have analyzed 7 {MCC} cell lines for the presence, integration pattern and copy number of {MCPyV}. In 5 cell lines, {MCPyV} specific sequences were detected. In 3 of these lines, multiple copies of viral genomes per cell were detected, and sequencing of {PCR} amplificates identified distinct mutations predicted to lead to the expression of a truncated large {T-Antigen} ({LT}-Ag). In 1 cell line, clonal integration of concatamerized viral genomes was confirmed by Southern Blotting. {MCC} cell lines are conventionally categorized as "classic" or "variant" and further divided into 4 subtypes, based on expression of neuroendocrine markers and morphology. While it has been suggested that the presence of {MCPyV} might promote a classic phenotype, such a notion is not supported by our data. Instead, we find {MCPyV}-positive as well as -negative lines of the classic variety, indicating that the distinguishing features are either inherently independent of viral infection or have become so in the course of tumorigenesis and/or cell line establishment. We therefore suggest a novel classification scheme based on {MCPyV} presence, integration patterns and {T-Ag} mutations. The cell lines described here extend the repertoire of available {MCPyV}-positive {MCC}-lines and should aid in the elucidation of the role of {MCPyV} in the pathogenesis of {MCC}.

@article{Hulsen2008BioVenn,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:In many genomics projects, numerous lists containing biological identifiers are produced. Often it is useful to see the overlap between different lists, enabling researchers to quickly observe similarities and differences between the data sets they are analyzing. One of the most popular methods to visualize the overlap and differences between data sets is the Venn diagram: a diagram consisting of two or more circles in which each circle corresponds to a data set, and the overlap between the circles corresponds to the overlap between the data sets. Venn diagrams are especially useful when they are 'area-proportional' i.e. the sizes of the circles and the overlaps correspond to the sizes of the data sets. Currently there are no programs available that can create area-proportional Venn diagrams connected to a wide range of biological {databases.RESULTS}:We designed a web application named {BioVenn} to summarize the overlap between two or three lists of identifiers, using area-proportional Venn diagrams. The user only needs to input these lists of identifiers in the textboxes and push the submit button. Parameters like colors and text size can be adjusted easily through the web interface. The position of the text can be adjusted by 'drag-and-drop' principle. The output Venn diagram can be shown as an {SVG} or {PNG} image embedded in the web application, or as a standalone {SVG} or {PNG} image. The latter option is useful for batch queries. Besides the Venn diagram, {BioVenn} outputs lists of identifiers for each of the resulting subsets. If an identifier is recognized as belonging to one of the supported biological databases, the output is linked to that database. Finally, {BioVenn} can map Affymetrix and {EntrezGene} identifiers to Ensembl {genes.CONCLUSION}:{BioVenn} is an easy-to-use web application to generate area-proportional Venn diagrams from lists of biological identifiers. It supports a wide range of identifiers from the most used biological databases currently available. Its implementation on the World Wide Web makes it available for use on any computer with internet connection, independent of operating system and without the need to install programs locally. {BioVenn} is freely accessible at http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/ webcite.},

@article{Gillet2011Redefining,
    abstract = {Although in vitro models have been a cornerstone of anti-cancer drug development, their direct applicability to clinical cancer research has been uncertain. Using a state-of-the-art Taqman-based quantitative {RT}-{PCR} assay, we investigated the multidrug resistance ({MDR}) transcriptome of six cancer types, in established cancer cell lines (grown in monolayer, {3D} scaffold, or in xenograft) and clinical samples, either containing >75\% tumor cells or microdissected. The {MDR} transcriptome was determined a priori based on an extensive curation of the literature published during the last three decades, which led to the enumeration of 380 genes. No correlation was found between clinical samples and established cancer cell lines. As expected, we found up-regulation of genes that would facilitate survival across all cultured cancer cell lines evaluated. More troubling, however, were data showing that all of the cell lines, grown either in vitro or in vivo, bear more resemblance to each other, regardless of the tissue of origin, than to the clinical samples they are supposed to model. Although cultured cells can be used to study many aspects of cancer biology and response of cells to drugs, this study emphasizes the necessity for new in vitro cancer models and the use of primary tumor models in which gene expression can be manipulated and small molecules tested in a setting that more closely mimics the in vivo cancer microenvironment so as to avoid radical changes in gene expression profiles brought on by extended periods of cell culture.},

                The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE}): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to {IGF1} receptor inhibitors; {AHR} expression was associated with {MEK} inhibitor efficacy in {NRAS}-mutant lines; and {SLFN11} expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.

@article{McCall2010Frozen,
    abstract = {Robust multiarray analysis ({RMA}) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. {RMA} performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides {RMA} various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) {RMA} cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen {RMA} ({fRMA}), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that {fRMA} is comparable to {RMA} when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms {RMA} when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package {fRMA} and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

Methods  We present a new case of Merkel cell carcinoma with sarcomatous differentiation. Results  The immunohistochemical staining patterns reflected the morphologic differentiation of the epithelial and sarcomatous pattern. After two months of follow-up, there were no signs of local recurrence or metastases. Conclusion  In all cases of merkelomas with sarcomatous differentiation described to date, lymph node metastases have been found, except in the presented case. However, larger series of cases will be required to determine if sarcomatous differentiation represents another negative prognostic factor.},

                Cell misidentification and cross-contamination have plagued biomedical research for as long as cells have been employed as research tools. Examples of misidentified cell lines continue to surface to this day. Efforts to eradicate the problem by raising awareness of the issue and by asking scientists voluntarily to take appropriate actions have not been successful. Unambiguous cell authentication is an essential step in the scientific process and should be an inherent consideration during peer review of papers submitted for publication or during review of grants submitted for funding. In order to facilitate proper identity testing, accurate, reliable, inexpensive, and standardized methods for authentication of cells and cell lines must be made available. To this end, an international team of scientists is, at this time, preparing a consensus standard on the authentication of human cells using short tandem repeat ({STR}) profiling. This standard, which will be submitted for review and approval as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute, will provide investigators guidance on the use of {STR} profiling for authenticating human cell lines. Such guidance will include methodological detail on the preparation of the {DNA} sample, the appropriate numbers and types of loci to be evaluated, and the interpretation and quality control of the results. Associated with the standard itself will be the establishment and maintenance of a public {STR} profile database under the auspices of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The consensus standard is anticipated to be adopted by granting agencies and scientific journals as appropriate methodology for authenticating human cell lines, stem cells, and tissues.

    abstract = {
                A human polyomavirus was recently discovered in Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) specimens. The Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCPyV}) genome undergoes clonal integration into the host cell chromosomes of {MCC} tumors and expresses small T antigen and truncated large T antigen. Previous studies have consistently reported that {MCPyV} can be detected in approximately 80\% of all {MCC} tumors. We sought to increase the sensitivity of detection of {MCPyV} in {MCC} by developing antibodies capable of detecting large T antigen by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we expanded the repertoire of quantitative {PCR} primers specific for {MCPyV} to improve the detection of viral {DNA} in {MCC}. Here we report that a novel monoclonal antibody detected {MCPyV} large T antigen expression in 56 of 58 (97\%) unique {MCC} tumors. {PCR} analysis specifically detected viral {DNA} in all 60 unique {MCC} tumors tested. We also detected inactivating point substitution mutations of {TP53} in the two {MCC} specimens that lacked large T antigen expression and in only 1 of 56 tumors positive for large T antigen. These results indicate that {MCPyV} is present in {MCC} tumors more frequently than previously reported and that mutations in {TP53} tend to occur in {MCC} tumors that fail to express {MCPyV} large T antigen.

Other suggested risk factors include sun exposure, immunosuppression, and a history of prior malignancy. Work up of patients with {MCC} most notably includes nodal staging via clinical examination or sentinel lymph node biopsy. The prognosis for most patients with {MCC} is poor, and the rarity of {MCC} precludes the prospective, randomized clinical trials necessary to elucidate optimum treatment protocols.

                Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely. These cell lines are well-recognized models for the study of health and disease, particularly for cancer. However, there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines, including the possibility of contamination, in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge. Cross-contamination, in which the contaminant is another cell line, was first recognized in the 1950s but, disturbingly, remains a serious issue today. Many cell lines become cross-contaminated early, so that subsequent experimental work has been performed only on the contaminant, masquerading under a different name. What can be done in response-how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross-contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here. First, it is important to check the literature, looking for previous work on cross-contamination. Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible, we have compiled a list of known cross-contaminated cell lines. The list currently contains 360 cell lines, drawn from 68 references. Most contaminants arise within the same species, with {HeLa} still the most frequently encountered (29\%, 106/360) among human cell lines, but interspecies contaminants account for a small but substantial minority of cases (9\%, 33/360). Second, even if there are no previous publications on cross-contamination for that cell line, it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing.

    abstract = {
                Correct diagnosis of the tissue origin of a metastatic cancer is the first step in disease management, but it is frequently difficult using standard pathologic methods. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has shown great promise as a new tool to address this challenge.
                Adoption of microarray technologies in the clinic remains limited. We aimed to bridge this technological gap by developing a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) assay.
                We constructed a microarray database of 466 frozen and 112 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) samples of both primary and metastatic tumors, measuring expression of 22,000 genes. From the microarray database, we used a genetic algorithm to search for gene combinations optimal for multitumor classification. A 92-gene {RT}-{PCR} assay was then designed and used to generate a database for 481 frozen and 119 {FFPE} tumor samples.
                The microarray-based K-nearest neighbor classifier demonstrated 84\% accuracy in classifying 39 tumor types via cross-validation and 82\% accuracy in predicting 112 independent {FFPE} samples. We successfully translated the microarray database to the {RT}-{PCR} platform, which allowed an overall success rate of 87\% in classifying 32 different tumor classes in the validation set of 119 {FFPE} tumor samples.
                The {RT}-{PCR}-based expression assay involving 92 genes represents a powerful tool for accurately and objectively identifying the site of origin for metastatic tumors, especially in the cases of cancer of unknown primary. The assay uses {RT}-{PCR} and routine {FFPE} samples, making it suitable for rapid clinical adoption.

                Accurate determination of cancer origin is necessary to guide optimal treatment but remains a diagnostic challenge. Gene expression profiling technologies have aided the classification of tumors and, therefore, could be applied in conjunction with clinicopathologic correlates to improve accuracy. We report an expanded version of the previously described 92-gene assay to classify 30 main tumor types and 54 histological subtypes, with coverage of ≥95\% of all solid tumors based on incidence. Increased tissue coverage was achieved through expansion of a reference tumor database containing 2,206 specimens, with a median of 62 samples per main tumor type. The 92-gene classification algorithm demonstrated sensitivities of 87\% and 85\% for 30 main types and 54 histological subtypes, respectively, in leave-one-out cross validation, and 83\% in a test set of 187 tumors representing 28 of the 30 main cancer types. These findings provide further support that broad and diverse tumor classification can be performed using a relatively compact gene set. An additional 300 consecutive cases submitted for clinical testing were profiled to characterize clinical utility in a real-world setting: the 92-gene assay confirmed 78\% of samples having a single suspected primary tumor and provided a single molecular prediction in 74\% of cases with two or more differential diagnoses. Further development of the 92-gene {RT}-{PCR} assay has resulted in a significant expansion in reportable tumor types and histological features with strong performance characteristics and supports the use of molecular classification as an objective standardized adjunct to current methods.

    abstract = {
                Twenty-nine patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary site were seen at Vanderbilt Medical Center between May 1977 and February 1987. All patients had pathologic findings typical of neuroendocrine tumors by electron microscopy (22 patients), light microscopy (6 patients), or immunochemical staining (1 patient). Patient age ranged from 18 to 77 years; 21 were men and 8 were women; and 12 had no history of tobacco use. Seventeen patients had metastatic tumor at two or more locations. Common metastatic sites included the retroperitoneum, lymph nodes (particularly cervical), and mediastinum. In most patients, these neoplasms showed an aggressive biology, with rapid onset of symptoms and rapid growth of metastases. Major responses were seen in 18 of 25 patients who received combination chemotherapy; 6 patients achieved a complete response. Three patients remain disease-free more than 24 months after completing therapy. Four patients with single sites of disease received local therapy only; all remain disease-free 1 to 10 years after completion of therapy. In 4 patients, specific tumor types were eventually recognized: small cell lung cancer, 1; gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, 2; and extragonadal germinal tumor with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation, 1. In the remaining 25 patients, no well-recognized type of neuroendocrine tumor was identified. Recognition of these tumors broadens the spectrum of neuroendocrine neoplasia, and also identifies a distinct subset of patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary site. Although optimal therapy remains undefined, these patients are usually responsive to combination chemotherapy, and long-term survival is attainable in a minority.

    abstract = {We describe a novel strategy (random forest clustering) for tumor profiling based on tissue microarray data. Random forest clustering is attractive for tissue microarray and other immunohistochemistry data since it handles highly skewed tumor marker expressions well and weighs the contribution of each marker according to its relatedness with other tumor markers. This is the first tumor class discovery analysis of renal cell carcinoma patients based on protein expression profiles. The tissue array data contained at least three tumor samples from each of 366 renal cell carcinoma patients. The eight tumor markers explore tumor proliferation, cell cycle abnormalities, cell mobility, and the hypoxia pathway. Since the procedure is unsupervised, no clinicopathological data or traditional classifications are used a priori. To explore whether the tissue microarray data can be used to identify fundamental subtypes of renal cell carcinoma patients, we first carried out random forest clustering of all 366 patients. By analyzing the tumor markers simultaneously, the procedure automatically detected classes that correspond to clear- vs non-clear cell tumors (demonstration of proof-of-principle). The resulting molecular grouping provides better prediction of survival (logrank P=0.000090) than this classical pathological grouping (logrank P=0.023). We then sought to extend the class discovery by searching for finer subclasses of clear cell patients. The procedure automatically discovered: (a) two classes corresponding to low- and high-grade patients (demonstration of proof-of-principle); (b) a subgroup of long-surviving clear cell patients with a distinct molecular profile and (c) two novel tumor subclasses in low-grade clear cell patients that could not be explained by any clinicopathological variables (demonstration of discovery).},

Use of the most accurate classification algorithms available for microarray gene expression data is a critical ingredient in order to develop the best possible molecular signatures for patient care. As suggested by a large body of literature to date, support vector machines can be considered "best of class" algorithms for classification of such data. Recent work, however, suggests that random forest classifiers may outperform support vector machines in this {domain.RESULTS}:In the present paper we identify methodological biases of prior work comparing random forests and support vector machines and conduct a new rigorous evaluation of the two algorithms that corrects these limitations. Our experiments use 22 diagnostic and prognostic datasets and show that support vector machines outperform random forests, often by a large margin. Our data also underlines the importance of sound research design in benchmarking and comparison of bioinformatics {algorithms.CONCLUSION}:We found that both on average and in the majority of microarray datasets, random forests are outperformed by support vector machines both in the settings when no gene selection is performed and when several popular gene selection methods are used.},

@article{DiazUriarte2006Gene,
    abstract = {
                Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection.
                We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including {DLDA}, {KNN}, and {SVM}, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy.
                Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data.

@article{Ambroise2002Selection,
    abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is synonymous with primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. It tends to affects elderly whites, but there is also an increased incidence among immunosuppressed patients. The recent identification of a novel polyomavirus associated with the tumor has stimulated renewed interest in its pathogenesis. {MCC} tends to show classic histologic features of a neuroendocrine carcinoma and is often positive for {CK20}, but nonclassic cytologic findings and unusual immunophenotypes may be observed and can lead to a diagnostic confusion. {MCC} needs to be distinguished from other primary cutaneous tumors with a small cell appearance and metastatic tumors. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, but radiation therapy has also found to be effective. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become an integral part of the staging of patients with {MCC}.

                To investigate whether immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 20 ({CK20}) and thyroid transcription factor 1 ({TTF}-1) is useful in distinguishing Merkel cell carcinomas ({MCCs}) from metastatic small cell carcinomas ({SCCs}).
                Eleven cases of {MCC} and 10 of lung {SCC} were stained for {CK20} and {TTF}-1.
                Ten of 11 {MCCs} stained with the antibody to {CK20}. None was positive for {TTF}-1. No {SCC} stained with {anti-CK20} and all stained strongly with {anti-TTF}-1.
                The use of both {anti-CK20} and {anti-TTF}-1 can reliably distinguish between {MCC} and metastatic {SCC}, thus avoiding the need for a detailed clinical investigation of patients with {MCC} in whom metastatic {SCC} must be excluded.

                The objective of this study was to define the incidence trends of Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}), a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy.
                All cases of {MCC} of the skin between 1986 and 2001 were identified using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results ({SEER}) program. Overall age-adjusted, gender-specific, age-specific, stage-specific, and regional incidence rates were calculated. All rates are per 100,000 and age-adjusted to the 2000 {US} standard population. Estimated annual percent change ({EAPC}) was calculated using a linear least squares model.
                A total of 1,124 cases of {MCC} were identified in the {SEER} registries. The rate of {MCC} increased from 0.15 cases per 100,000 in 1986 to 0.44 cases per 100,000 in 2001. The {EAPC} for the time period was 8.08\%. This was statistically significant (95\% {CI}: 6.29, 9.90, P-value < 0.05). Age-specific incidence (5-year age groups) were highest in the elderly, 4.28 per 100,000 in the 85+ age group.
                {MCC} incidence rates have increased threefold over the 1986-2001 period. Rates are highest in the elderly population. Further etiologic studies and identification of high-risk populations are warranted.

    abstract = {
                In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix {GeneChip} system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five {MGU74A} mouse {GeneChip} arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 {HG}-{U95A} human {GeneChip} arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 {HG}-{U95A} {GeneChip} arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe ({PM} and {MM}) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference ({AvDiff}) and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index ({MBEI}). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average ({RMA}) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA}) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error ({SE}) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.

    abstract = {
                Cancer cell lines are used worldwide in biological research, and data interpretation depends on unambiguous attribution of the respective cell line to its original source. Short-tandem-repeat ({STR}) profiling ({DNA} fingerprinting) is the method of choice for this purpose; however, the genetic stability of cell lines under various experimental conditions is not well defined. We tested the effect of long-term culture, subcloning, and generation of drug-resistant subclones on fingerprinting profiles in four widely used leukemia cell lines. The {DNA} fingerprinting profile remained unaltered in two of them (U937 and K562) throughout 12 months in culture, and the vast majority of subclones derived therefrom by limiting dilution after long-term culture revealed the same profile, indicating a high degree of stability and clonotypic homogeneity. In contrast, two other cell lines ({CCRF}-{CEM} and Jurkat) showed marked alterations in {DNA} fingerprinting profiles during long-term culture. Limiting dilution subcloning revealed extensive clonotypic heterogeneity with subclones differing in up to eight {STR} loci from the parental culture. Similar heterogeneity was observed in subclones generated by selection culture for drug resistance where {DNA} fingerprinting proved useful in identifying possible resistance mechanisms. Thus, common tissue culture procedures may dramatically affect the fingerprinting profile of certain cell lines and thus render definition of their origin difficult.

Merkel cell-neurite complexes are touch receptors composed of sensory afferents and Merkel cells. The role that Merkel cells play in light-touch responses has been the center of controversy for over 100 years. We used {Cre-loxP} technology to conditionally delete the transcription factor Atoh1 from the body skin and foot pads of mice. Merkel cells are absent from these areas in {Atoh1CKO} animals. Ex vivo skin/nerve preparations from {Atoh1CKO} animals demonstrate complete loss of the characteristic neurophysiologic responses normally mediated by Merkel cell-neurite complexes. Merkel cells are, therefore, required for the proper encoding of Merkel receptor responses, suggesting that these cells form an indispensible part of the somatosensory system. 10.1126/science.1172890},

    abstract = {The cutaneous somatosensory system contains multiple types of mechanoreceptors that detect different mechanical stimuli (Johnson, 2001). These stimuli, either alone or in combination, are ultimately interpreted by the brain as different aspects of the sense of touch. Psychophysical and electrophysiological experiments in humans and other mammals implicate one of these mechanoreceptors, the Merkel cell/neurite complex, in two-point discrimination and the detection of curvature, shape, and texture (Johnson and Lamb, 1981; Johnson et al., 2000; Johnson, 2001). However, whether Merkel cell/neurite complex function is required for the detection of these stimuli is unknown. We genetically engineered mice that lack Merkel cells (Maricich et al., 2009; Morrison et al., 2009) to directly test the hypothesis that Merkel cell/neurite complexes are necessary to perform these types of sensory discrimination tasks. We found that mice devoid of Merkel cells could not detect textured surfaces with their feet while other measures of motor and sensory function were unaffected. Interestingly, these mice retained the ability to discriminate both texture and shape using their whiskers, suggesting that other somatosensory afferents can functionally substitute for Merkel cell/neurite complexes in this sensory organ. These findings suggest that Merkel cell/neurite complexes are essential for texture discrimination tasks involving glabrous skin but not whiskers.},

We identified the {hVam6p} cytoplasmic protein involved in lysosomal processing as a novel interactor with {MCV} {LT} but not {SV40} {LT}. {hVam6p} binds through its clathrin heavy chain homology domain to a unique region of {MCV} {LT} adjacent to the retinoblastoma binding site. {MCV} {LT} translocates {hVam6p} to the nucleus, sequestering it from involvement in lysosomal trafficking. A naturally occurring, tumor-derived mutant {LT} ({MCV350}) lacking a nuclear localization signal binds {hVam6p} but fails to inhibit {hVam6p}-induced lysosomal clustering. {MCV} has evolved a novel mechanism to target {hVam6p} that may contribute to viral uncoating or egress through lysosomal processing during virus replication.},

                The process of malignant transformation, progression and metastasis of melanoma is poorly understood. Gene expression profiling of human cancer has allowed for a unique insight into the genes that are involved in these processes. Thus, we have attempted to utilize this approach through the analysis of a series of primary, non-metastatic cutaneous tumors and metastatic melanoma samples.
                We have utilized gene microarray analysis and a variety of molecular techniques to compare 40 metastatic melanoma ({MM}) samples, composed of 22 bulky, macroscopic (replaced) lymph node metastases, 16 subcutaneous and 2 distant metastases (adrenal and brain), to 42 primary cutaneous cancers, comprised of 16 melanoma, 11 squamous cell, 15 basal cell skin cancers. A Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array from Affymetrix, Inc. was utilized for each sample. A variety of statistical software, including the Affymetrix {MAS} 5.0 analysis software, was utilized to compare primary cancers to metastatic melanomas. Separate analyses were performed to directly compare only primary melanoma to metastatic melanoma samples. The expression levels of putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were analyzed by semi- and real-time quantitative {RT}-{PCR} ({qPCR}) and Western blot analysis was performed on select genes.
                We find that primary basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and thin melanomas express dramatically higher levels of many genes, including {SPRR1A}/B, {KRT16}/17, {CD24}, {LOR}, {GATA3}, {MUC15}, and {TMPRSS4}, than metastatic melanoma. In contrast, the metastatic melanomas express higher levels of genes such as {MAGE}, {GPR19}, {BCL2A1}, {MMP14}, {SOX5}, {BUB1}, {RGS20}, and more. The transition from non-metastatic expression levels to metastatic expression levels occurs as melanoma tumors thicken. We further evaluated primary melanomas of varying Breslow's tumor thickness to determine that the transition in expression occurs at different thicknesses for different genes suggesting that the "transition zone" represents a critical time for the emergence of the metastatic phenotype. Several putative tumor oncogenes ({SPP}-1, {MITF}, {CITED}-1, {GDF}-15, {c-Met}, {HOX} loci) and suppressor genes ({PITX}-1, {CST}-6, {PDGFRL}, {DSC}-3, {POU2F3}, {CLCA2}, {ST7L}), were identified and validated by quantitative {PCR} as changing expression during this transition period. These are strong candidates for genes involved in the progression or suppression of the metastatic phenotype.
                The gene expression profiling of primary, non-metastatic cutaneous tumors and metastatic melanoma has resulted in the identification of several genes that may be centrally involved in the progression and metastatic potential of melanoma. This has very important implications as we continue to develop an improved understanding of the metastatic process, allowing us to identify specific genes for prognostic markers and possibly for targeted therapeutic approaches.

                Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood brain tumour comprising four discrete subgroups. Here, to identify mutations that drive medulloblastoma, we sequenced the entire genomes of 37 tumours and matched normal blood. One-hundred and thirty-six genes harbouring somatic mutations in this discovery set were sequenced in an additional 56 medulloblastomas. Recurrent mutations were detected in 41 genes not yet implicated in medulloblastoma; several target distinct components of the epigenetic machinery in different disease subgroups, such as regulators of {H3K27} and {H3K4} trimethylation in subgroups 3 and 4 (for example, {KDM6A} and {ZMYM3}), and {CTNNB1}-associated chromatin re-modellers in {WNT}-subgroup tumours (for example, {SMARCA4} and {CREBBP}). Modelling of mutations in mouse lower rhombic lip progenitors that generate {WNT}-subgroup tumours identified genes that maintain this cell lineage ({DDX3X}), as well as mutated genes that initiate ({CDH1}) or cooperate ({PIK3CA}) in tumorigenesis. These data provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma subgroups and highlight targets for therapeutic development.

                The Hedgehog signaling pathway is important for human development and carcinogenesis in various malignancies.
                One tissue microarray with triplets of 28 samples from 25 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) was constructed. Six samples of normal skin and 5 samples of normal oral mucosa served as controls. All samples were analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies directed against Sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, Patched, Smoothened, Gli-1, Gli-2, and Gli-3.
                All investigated proteins were frequently and intensely overexpressed in {MCCs} (Sonic hedgehog, 93\%; Indian hedgehog, 84\%; Patched, 86\%; Smoothened, 79\%; Gli-1, 79\%; Gli-2, 79\%; Gli-3, 86\%) compared with control samples. High levels of Patched and Indian hedgehog were significantly associated with an increase in patients overall (p = .015) and recurrence-free survival (p = .011), respectively.
                Our results indicate that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is strongly activated in {MCC} and thus may play a role in carcinogenesis.

    abstract = {
                Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.

The causal role of {MCPyV} is highly suggested by monoclonal integration of its genome and expression of the viral large T ({LT}) antigen in {MCC} cells. We investigated and characterized {MCPyV} molecular features in {MCC}, respiratory, urine and blood samples from 33 patients by quantitative {PCR}, sequencing and detection of integrated viral {DNA}. We examined associations between either {MCPyV} viral load in primary {MCC} or {MCPyV} {DNAemia} and survival. Results were interpreted with respect to the viral molecular signature in each compartment. Patients with {MCC} containing more than 1 viral genome copy per cell had a longer period in complete remission than patients with less than 1 copy per cell (34 vs 10 months, P = 0.037). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) contained {MCPyV} more frequently in patients sampled with disease than in patients in complete remission (60\% vs 11\%, P = 0.00083). Moreover, the detection of {MCPyV} in at least one {PBMC} sample during follow-up was associated with a shorter overall survival (P = 0.003). Sequencing of viral {DNA} from {MCC} and non {MCC} samples characterized common single nucleotide polymorphisms defining 8 patient specific strains. However, specific molecular signatures truncating {MCPyV} {LT} were observed in 8/12 {MCC} cases but not in respiratory and urinary samples from 15 patients. New integration sites were identified in 4 {MCC} cases. Finally, mutated-integrated forms of {MCPyV} were detected in {PBMC} of two patients with disseminated {MCC} disease, indicating circulation of metastatic cells. We conclude that {MCPyV} molecular features in primary {MCC} tumour and {PBMC} may help to predict the course of the disease. Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCPyV}) is a recently discovered virus highly associated with a rare skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}). The causal role of {MCPyV} in cancer is suggested by integration of viral sequences into the cell genome and by a specific molecular signature. We looked for and compared molecular species of {MCPyV} in tumour and non tumour samples of 33 {MCC} patients. We showed that a tumour viral load greater than 1 copy per cell was associated with a better outcome, and that detection of the virus in blood but not in urine correlated with a shorter overall survival. A tumour–specific molecular signature was found in the blood of two patients with metastatic disease, but did not occur in their respiratory nor urine samples. We propose that molecular analysis of {MCPyV} in tumour and blood be used as a biomarker of infection and cancer progression in {MCC} patients.},

    abstract = {
                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a rare, highly metastatic skin tumor of neuroectodermal origin. The disease shares clinical and histopathological features with small cell lung carcinoma ({SCLC}). The genetic mechanisms underlying the development and tumor progression of {MCC} are poorly understood. We recently showed by comparative genomic hybridization ({CGH}) that the pattern of chromosomal abnormalities in {MCC} resembles that of {SCLC}. One of the most frequently observed losses involved the entire chromosome 10 or partial loss of the chromosome 10 long arm (33\% of examined {MCC} cases). The {PTEN} tumor-suppressor gene has been mapped to 10q23.3 and was shown to be mutated in a variety of human cancers including {SCLC}. Germline {PTEN} mutations have been observed in familial predisposing cancer syndromes including Cowden disease. Interestingly, an association between Cowden syndrome and Merkel cell carcinoma has been reported. To study the possible role of {PTEN} in {MCC} oncogenesis, loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) analysis for the 10q23 region was performed on 26 {MCC} tumor samples from 23 {MCC} patients. The {PTEN} locus was deleted in 9 of 21 (43\%) informative {MCC} tumor samples [7 of 18 (39\%) {MCC} patients]. Despite this high frequency of {LOH} at 10q23, mutation and homozygous deletion screening of the {PTEN} gene revealed only one tumor with a nonsense mutation and a second with a homozygous deletion of exon 9. These data suggest that either alternative mechanisms lead to inactivation of the {PTEN} gene or that other tumor-suppressor genes at chromosome 10 are implicated in the development of {MCC}.

                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is an aggressive cutaneous tumor with poor outcome and increasing incidence. We examined by immunohistochemistry the expression of three novel matrix metalloproteinases ({MMPs})-{MMP}-21, {MMP}-26, and {MMP}-28-in 44 primary {MCC} tumors and six lymph node metastases while {MMP}-10 served as a positive control. Their {mRNA} expression was also studied in the {UISO} {MCC} cell line basally and after various stimulations using quantitative real-time {PCR}. {MMP}-28 was observed in tumor cells of 15/44 samples especially in tumors <2 cm in diameter (p = 0.015) while 21/44 specimens showed {MMP}-28 in the tumor stroma. Expression of {MMP}-21 was demonstrated in tumor cells of 13/43 samples. {MMP}-26, instead, was positive in stromal cells (17/44) and its expression associated with tumors >or=2 cm in diameter (p = 0.006). Stromal expression of {MMP}-10 was the most frequent finding of the studied samples (31/44), but {MMP}-10 was detected also in tumor cells (17/44). Most of the metastatic lymph nodes expressed {MMP}-10 and {MMP}-26. {MMP}-10, {MMP}-21, and {MMP}-28 {mRNAs} were basally expressed by the {UISO} cells, and the corresponding proteins were detectable by immunostaining of cultured cells. {IFN}-alpha and {TNF}-alpha downregulated {MMP}-21 and {MMP}-28 expression. Our results suggest that novel {MMPs} may have a role in {MCC} pathogenesis: especially that {MMP}-26 expression in stroma is associated with larger tumors with poor prognosis. Expression of {MMP}-21 and {MMP}-28 seems to associate with the tumors of lesser malignant potential. We also confirm the previous finding on the role of {MMP}-10 in {MCC} pathogenesis.

                The Raf kinase inhibitor protein ({RKIP}) has been shown to block {MAP} kinase pathway as well as {NFkappaB} signalling. By means of immunohistochemistry, we previously demonstrated that the {MAP} kinase pathway is virtually inactive in Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}). Similarly to {MCC} in situ high {RKIP} expression accompanies absence of {ERK} phosphorylation in the {MCC} cell line {UISO} suggesting that {RKIP} might be causative for {MAP} kinase pathway silencing.
                Applying an {siRNA} approach {RKIP} expression was knocked down in {UISO} cells and a possible influence on {MAP} kinase pathway activity was assessed by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. Moreover, a possible effect of {RKIP} knock down in {UISO} cells on proliferation as well as chemosensitivity to cisplatin were examined applying the {MTS} assay.
                Surprisingly the absence of phosphorylation of the {MAP} kinases {ERK1} and {ERK} 2 even following growth factor stimulation was not affected by the {RKIP} knock down indicating that {RKIP} is not essential for blocking the {MAP} kinase pathway in the {MCC} cell line {UISO}. Moreover, proliferation as well as chemosensitivity towards cisplatin were not altered upon knock down of {RKIP}.

@article{Houben2007Activation,
    abstract = {
                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a rare but highly aggressive tumor of the skin. Recently, we have shown that {MCC} cells in situ are characterized by a complete absence of mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathway signaling, which is preserved in the {MCC} cell line {UISO}. Here we present data suggesting that silencing of the {MAPK} pathway is essential for the survival of {MCC} cells. Activation of the {MAPK} pathway could be achieved by inducing a regulatable form of the {c-Raf}-1 kinase domain in {UISO} cells. Consequently, {MAPK} signaling led to morphological changes, loss of actin stress fibers, and induction of apoptosis, which could be prevented by the {MAP} kinase kinase-specific inhibitor U0126. Hence, despite the fact that activation of the {MAPK} pathway contributes to oncogenesis in many cancers, it seems to be a negative selection factor for {MCC} cells. Since {ERK} phosphorylation was also inducible by the Raf-activating pharmacological agent {ZM336372}, these results provide new perspectives for potential therapeutics for this highly aggressive tumor.

    abstract = {Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a rare aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. Only little information is available on the genetic alterations occurring in this tumor. Cytogenetic studies thus far have not shown recurrent chromosomal changes, although various structural chromosome 1 rearrangements, including deletions, often leading to loss of distal 1p material appear to be frequent. We report on fluorescence in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity analyses of an {MCC} tumor and {MCC} cell line {UISO}. The present study has shown that two distinct regions in the most distal band 1p36 on the short arm of chromosome 1 can be implicated in {MCC}. One region at 1p36.3 was delineated by a distal deletion in the {MCC} tumor as a result of an unbalanced translocation, resulting in loss of all markers distal to {ENO1}. This region was previously shown to be deleted in different tumor types including neuroblastoma. In cell line {UISO} an insertion in 1p36.2 was identified. The insertion breakpoint indicates a second, more proximal, region on 1p involved in {MCC}. The insertion breakpoint was mapped within a cluster of repetitive {tRNA} and {snRNA} genes and thus could coincide with the constitutional 1p36 breakpoint previously reported in a patient with neuroblastoma.},

    abstract = {Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a rare aggressive skin tumor which shares histopathological and genetic features with small-cell lung carcinoma ({SCLC}), both are of neuroendocrine origin. Comparable to {SCLC}, {MCC} cell lines are classified into two different biochemical subgroups designated as 'Classic' and 'Variant'. With the aim to identify typical gene-expression signatures associated with these phenotypically different {MCC} cell lines subgroups and to search for differentially expressed genes between {MCC} and {SCLC}, we used {cDNA} arrays to profile 10 {MCC} cell lines and four {SCLC} cell lines. Using significance analysis of microarrays, we defined a set of 76 differentially expressed genes that allowed unequivocal identification of Classic and Variant {MCC} subgroups. We assume that the differential expression levels of some of these genes reflect, analogous to {SCLC}, the different biological and clinical properties of Classic and Variant {MCC} phenotypes. Therefore, they may serve as useful prognostic markers and potential targets for the development of new therapeutic interventions specific for each subgroup. Moreover, our analysis identified 17 powerful classifier genes capable of discriminating {MCC} from {SCLC}. Real-time quantitative {RT}–{PCR} analysis of these genes on 26 additional {MCC} and {SCLC} samples confirmed their diagnostic classification potential, opening opportunities for new investigations into these aggressive cancers.},

                The primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin or Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a skin tumor with aggressive biological behaviour. Experimental models for investigating the biological properties of the tumor are prerequisite for developing new therapeutic approaches. In this study, we report the establishment and characterisation of a cell line derived from the lymph-node metastasis of a patient with highly aggressive {MCC}. Merkel carcinoma cells ({MCC}-1) grew as floating aggregates in suspension cultures for more than two years and over 70 subcultures. The proliferation rate in suspension cultures was rather moderate with a population doubling time of 69 h. The immunocytochemical pattern of the cultured {MCC}-1 was similar to that of the original tumor with expression of cytokeratin 18, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilaments, and synaptophysin. In addition, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) revealed presence of chromogranin A {mRNA} in the {MCC}-1 cell line. Furthermore, electron microscopy yielded the rare finding of neuroendocrine granules in the cytoplasm of the cultured cells. The cell line {MCC}-1 was able to form colonies in soft agar. Nude mice developed solid tumors with similar histology to the original tumor after subcutaneous and intravenous injections of cultured {MCC}-1, and malignant ascites was seen after intraperitoneal injection. Also, two {MCC}-1 sublines were established by reculturing cells from the xenografts grown in vivo and immunocytochemistry confirmed their neuroendocrine origin. The {MCC}-1 line may thus serve as a model for studying the biology and the metastatic potential of Merkel cell carcinoma.

                A neuroendocrine skin carcinoma cell line {MKL}-1 has been established from a nodal metastasis in a 26-year-old patient. The line grows as irregularly outlined, loosely packed floating aggregates lacking central necrosis. {MKL}-1 is hyperdiploid and has a mean doubling time of 120 hours. Xenografts of 2 X 10(7) {MKL}-1 cells produce tumors in nude mice at 4 to 6 weeks after subcutaneous inoculation. The xenografts were morphologically indistinguishable from the original skin primary and the nodal metastasis. Electron microscopy revealed sparse membrane-bound neurosecretory granules, and conspicuous, paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments. Immunohistochemical study showed diffuse and consistent staining with neuron-specific enolase, while bombesin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, Leu-enkephalin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide displayed heterogeneous and variable expression. Uniform staining of all cells appearing as cytoplasmic fibrils and paranuclear aggregates was noted with antibodies to cytokeratin. Appreciable amounts of cytokeratin polypeptides 8, 18, and 19 and {IT} protein were seen on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cytoskeletal preparations from {MKL}-1 cells and from tumor-rich frozen sections. Immunostaining also showed coexpression of neurofilaments arranged in paranuclear aggregates; gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting demonstrated the presence in {MKL}-1 cells of prominent amounts of the small neurofilament polypeptide. Focal expression of desmoplakin was noted in the xenografts. The cells reacted with monoclonal antibodies {anti-Leu}-7 and {anti-Leu}-M1 but did not react with antibodies to human lymphocyte antigens ({HLA})-A, {HLA}-B, and {HLA}-C. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 3 chromosomally abnormal cell lines with the majority of metaphase cells demonstrating a gain of an isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 5. Thus, {MKL}-1 cell line shares several characteristics with small cell neuroendocrine bronchopulmonary carcinoma cell lines but shows distinct cytogenetic abnormalities.

The mestastases in vivo were characterized by co-expression of cytokeratins 8, 18, 19, 20 and neurofilaments, presence of intermediate filament whirls, expression of synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A, rare and weak immunostaining for plakoglobin but absence of cadherins and desmoplakins. Both cultures grow, using supplemented {RPMI} medium on human irradiated fibroblast feeder layers, as loosely arranged floating small aggregates. Their karyotypes are mostly hyperdiploid. The mean doubling times were about 84 h in the first 8 months and later increased. Ultrastructural and immunoelectron microscopic studies of the Merkel cell tumor cells in vitro ({MC}-{MA1}, {MC}-{MA2}) revealed sparse membrane-bound neuroendocrine granules and typical {IFs} that were partly arranged in paranuclear whirls and were labeled by antibodies against cytokeratins and neurofilaments. In immunocytochemical studies using antibodies to cytokeratins 8, 18, 19, and 20 and neurofilament protein {NF}-L, Merkel cell tumor cells in vitro showed a uniform staining appearing as paranuclear whirls and cytoplasmic fibrils as well. Double-labeling experiments showed a co-localization of both intermediate filament types in most cells. Biochemically we found cytokeratins 8, 18, 19, and 20, and {NF}-L in tumor cells in vitro. Immunocytochemical staining was negative for desmoplakins, various cadherins, and cell adhesion molecules, whereas plakoglobin was only rarely detectable in some Merkel cell tumor cells in vitro. By immunoluminometric assay chromogranin A was detected in cell homogenates and culture supernatants as well. Immunocytochemically, synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase were detectable additionally in some of the cells. These established cell cultures will allow further studies devoted to the biology, differentiation, and hormone secretion of Merkel cell tumors that may also increase our knowledge about normal Merkel cells.},

                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. We studied {MCC} samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. Further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387-base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCV} or {MCPyV}). {MCV} sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80\%) {MCC} tumors but only 5 of 59 (8\%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16\%) control skin tissues. In six of eight {MCV}-positive {MCCs}, viral {DNA} was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that {MCV} infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Thus, {MCV} may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of {MCC}.

                To identify factors associated with survival in Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}).
                Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare cutaneous neoplasm. Staging and treatment are based on studies, which incompletely characterize the disease.
                Review of a prospective database was performed. Overall survival ({OS}) was estimated by the {Kaplan-Meier} method. Disease-specific death ({DSD}) was analyzed by the competing risks method. Factors associated with {OS} and {DSD} were determined by the log-rank test and Gray's test, respectively.
                A total of 500 patients with {MCC} treated at our institution from 1969 to 2010 were identified. Eighty-eight patients presented older than 6 months after diagnosis and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 412 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 71 years. Median follow-up was 3 years. Fifty percent of patients died during follow-up: 25\% died of disease, 24\% died of other causes. Five-year {OS} and {DSD} were 56\% and 30\%, respectively. Pathologic stage and lymphovascular invasion were independent predictors of {DSD}. Patients with metastatic disease (stage 4) or clinically positive lymph nodes (stage 3b) had increased {DSD} compared with patients with microscopically positive (stage 3a) or negative lymph nodes (stage 1 and 2). There was no difference in {DSD} between stage 3a or 2 compared with stage 1. Importantly, only 1 of 132 patients without lymphovascular invasion died of {MCC}.
                {OS} is a poor measure of the influence of {MCC} on life expectancy. The presence of lymphovascular invasion and clinically, but not microscopically, positive lymph nodes were associated with increased {DSD}. These factors should be incorporated into {MCC} staging and treatment recommendations.

@article{Demetriou2012Defective,
    abstract = {The pathways by which Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCV}) infection contributes to the formation of Merkel cell carcinomas are important for understanding the pathogenesis of these cancers. We hypothesized that {MCV} T antigen suppresses normal responses to ultraviolet radiation ({UVR})-induced {DNA} damage. An {MCV}-infected cell line ({MKL}-1) exhibited {UVR} hypersensitivity, impaired repair of {DNA} lesions and cell cycle arrest after {UVR}, as well as reduced levels of the {DNA} damage recognition protein, {XPC}. When ectopically expressed in uninfected {UISO} cells, mutant but not wild-type T antigen resulted in loss of repair of {UVR}-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and reductions in {XPC}, p53 and p21 levels, whereas both wild-type and mutant T antigen inhibited cell cycle arrest after {UVR}. Similarly, only mutant T antigen in normal fibroblasts inhibited {DNA} repair and {XPC} expression, while both mutant and wild-type T antigens produced cell cycle dysregulation. Wild-type T antigen expression produced large T, 57 {kT} and small T antigens while mutant T antigen was only detectable as a truncated large T antigen protein. Expression of wild-type large T antigen but not small T antigen inhibited the G1 checkpoint in {UISO} cells, but neither wild-type large T nor small T antigens affected {DNA} repair, suggesting that large T antigen generates cell cycle defects, and when mutated may also impair {DNA} repair. These results indicate that T antigen expression by {MCV} can inhibit key responses to {UVR}-induced {DNA} damage and suggest that progressive {MCV}-mediated abrogation of genomic stability may be involved in Merkel cell carcinogenesis.},

All 13 cases of Merkel cell carcinoma evaluated were positive for {CK20}, and negative for {TTF}-1. Twelve of 13 Merkel cell carcinoma cases were positive for {NF}. Eleven of 13 cases of small cell lung carcinoma were positive for {TTF}-1. All small cell lung carcinoma cases were negative for {NF}, and all but one were negative for {CK20}. In terms of the remaining antigens, there were no differences of significance between the two neoplasms. These findings suggest that a set of three immunohistochemical stains, including {CK20}, {NF}, and {TTF}-1, is useful in affording a distinction between Merkel cell carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma.

                Merkel cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma of the skin is a rare skin cancer seen in increasing numbers in Queensland, Australia. In its clinical course and histopathology, it resembles small cell lung carcinoma ({SCLC}). Little is known of the genetic basis of this disease except for a number of cytogenetic studies and three loss of heterozygosity studies. Therefore, comparative genomic hybridization was performed to determine the characteristic {DNA} gains and losses that occur in this tumor. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 34 specimens from 24 patients revealed a pattern of gains and losses that closely resembles that seen in {SCLC}. Overall frequent loss was seen for chromosomes 3p (46\%), 5q (21\%), 8p (21\%), 10 (33\%), 11q (17\%), 13q (33\%), and 17p (25\%). Significant gains were seen for chromosomes 1 (63\%), 3q (33\%), 5p (38\%), 8q (38\%), 19 (63\%), and X (41\%), with smaller numbers having gains for chromosomes 6, 7, 20, and 21. In contrast to {SCLC}, amplification in Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare event.

Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the pathologic features of {MCC} implanted into athymic mice and to determine cytogenetic abnormalities in the established cell line. Methods: Tumor tissues from a patient with {MCC} were grown in culture. Cultured cells were karyotyped and inoculated subcutaneously into athymic mice. Nude mouse tumors were reimplanted into other athymic mice. Tissues from the primary skin tumor and the nude mouse tumor were processed for light and electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Results: The cell line showed a doubling time of 64.8 hours. Xenografts of 4 × 106 cells produced tumors in athymic mice with a doubling time of 16.1 days. The nude mouse tumors showed pathologic features similar to those of the primary skin tumor. Cytogenetic studies showed a t(1;17) (p36;q21) translocation in 100\% of the cells. Conclusion: {MCC} implanted into athymic mice retained the pathologic features of the primary skin tumor and behaved aggressively. The t(l;17) (p36;q21) translocation may be a marker of an aggressive phenotype.},

Cytogenetic studies have indicated that deletions and unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 1 short arm material occur in 40\% of the investigated cases. Recurrent chromosomal imbalances detected by comparative genomic hybridization ({CGH}) analysis were loss of 3p, 10q, 13q and 17p and gains of 1q, 3q, 5p and 8q. In order to study genomic aberrations occurring in {MCC} in further detail, we combined karyotyping, {CGH} and multiplex-fluorescence in situ hybridization ({M-FISH}), a strategy that proved to be successful in the analysis of other malignancies. Analysis of 6 {MCC} cell lines and 1 {MCC} tumor revealed mostly near-diploid karyotypes with an average of 5 chromosomal rearrangements. The observed karyotypic changes were heterogeneous, with 3–27 breakpoints per case, leading to imbalance of the involved chromosomal regions that was confirmed by {CGH}. Chromosomal rearrangements involving the short arm of chromosome 1, the long arm of chromosome 3 and gain of 5p material were the most frequently observed abnormalities in our study. In keeping with previous observations, this series of {MCCs} showed no evidence for high-level amplification. We provid a detailed description of chromosomal translocations occurring in {MCC} that could be useful to direct future intensive investigation of these chromosomal regions. {\copyright} 2002 {Wiley-Liss}, Inc.},

Three regions of genomic alteration were of particular interest: a deletion of 5q12-21 occurred in 26\% of tumors, a deletion of 13q14-21 was recurrent in 26\% of tumors and contains the well-characterized tumor suppressor {RB1}, and a previously unreported focal amplification at 1p34 was present in 39\% of tumors and centers on {L-Myc} ({MYCL1}). {L-Myc} is related to the {c-Myc} proto-oncogene, has transforming activity, and is amplified in the closely related small cell lung cancer. Normal skin showed no {L-Myc} expression, whereas 4/4 {MCC} specimens tested expressed {L-Myc} {RNA} in relative proportion to the {DNA} copy number gain.

                Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is a polyomavirus-associated skin cancer that is frequently lethal and lacks established prognostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify biomarkers that improve prognostic accuracy and provide insight into {MCC} biology.
                Gene expression profiles of 35 {MCC} tumors were clustered based on prognosis. The cluster of genes overexpressed in good-prognosis tumors was tested for biologic process enrichment. Relevant {mRNA} expression differences were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. An independent set of 146 nonoverlapping {MCC} tumors (median follow-up, 25 months among 116 living patients) was employed for biomarker validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.
                Immune response gene signatures were prominent in patients with good prognoses. In particular, genes associated with cytotoxic {CD8}+ lymphocytes were overexpressed in tumors from patients with favorable prognoses. In the independent validation set, cases with robust intratumoral {CD8}+ lymphocyte infiltration had improved outcomes (100\% {MCC}-specific survival, n = 26) compared with instances characterized by sparse infiltration (60\% survival, n = 120). Only stage and intratumoral {CD8} infiltration (but not age, sex, or {CD8}+ lymphocytes localized to the tumor-stroma interface) were significant in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Notably, traditional histologic identification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was not a significant independent predictor of survival.
                Intratumoral {CD8}+ lymphocyte infiltration can be readily assessed on paraffin-embedded tissue, is independently associated with improved {MCC}-specific survival, and therefore, may provide prognostic information that enhances established {MCC} staging protocols.

@article{Houben2010Merkel,
    abstract = {Merkel cell carcinoma ({MCC}) is the most aggressive skin cancer. Recently, it was demonstrated that human Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCV}) is clonally integrated in ∼80\% of {MCC} tumors. However, direct evidence for whether oncogenic viral proteins are needed for the maintenance of {MCC} cells is still missing. To address this question, we knocked down {MCV} T-antigen ({TA}) expression in {MCV}-positive {MCC} cell lines using three different short hairpin {RNA} ({shRNA})-expressing vectors targeting exon 1 of the {TAs}. The {MCC} cell lines used include three newly generated {MCV}-infected cell lines and one {MCV}-negative cell line from {MCC} tumors. Notably, all {MCV}-positive {MCC} cell lines underwent growth arrest and/or cell death upon {TA} knockdown, whereas the proliferation of {MCV}-negative cell lines remained unaffected. Despite an increase in the number of annexin V-positive, 7-amino-actinomycin D ({7-AAD})-negative cells upon {TA} knockdown, activation of caspases or changes in the expression and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members were not consistently detected after {TA} suppression. Our study provides the first direct experimental evidence that {TA} expression is necessary for the maintenance of {MCV}-positive {MCC} and that {MCV} is the infectious cause of {MCV}-positive {MCC}.},

@article{Shuda2008T,
    abstract = {Merkel cell polyomavirus ({MCV}) is a virus discovered in our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh that is monoclonally integrated into the genome of ≈80\% of human Merkel cell carcinomas ({MCCs}). Transcript mapping was performed to show that {MCV} expresses transcripts in {MCCs} similar to large T ({LT}), small T ({ST}), and {17kT} transcripts of {SV40}. Nine {MCC} tumor-derived {LT} genomic sequences have been examined, and all were found to harbor mutations prematurely truncating the {MCV} {LT} helicase. In contrast, four presumed episomal viruses from nontumor sources did not possess this T antigen signature mutation. Using coimmunoprecipitation and origin replication assays, we show that tumor-derived virus mutations do not affect retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) binding by {LT} but do eliminate viral {DNA} replication capacity. Identification of an {MCC} cell line ({MKL}-1) having monoclonal {MCV} integration and the signature {LT} mutation allowed us to functionally test both tumor-derived and wild type ({WT}) T antigens. Only {WT} {LT} expression activates replication of integrated {MCV} {DNA} in {MKL}-1 cells. Our findings suggest that {MCV}-positive {MCC} tumor cells undergo selection for {LT} mutations to prevent autoactivation of integrated virus replication that would be detrimental to cell survival. Because these mutations render the virus replication-incompetent, {MCV} is not a  ” passenger virus” that secondarily infects {MCC} tumors.},

@article{Kanehisa2000KEGG,
    abstract = {{KEGG} (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the {GENES} database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND} for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).},
